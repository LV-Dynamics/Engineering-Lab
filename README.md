# Engineering Lab

Personal engineering laboratory documenting my learning journey in:

- scientific computing
- control systems
- robotics fundamentals
- numerical simulation
- autonomous systems
- aerospace and orbital mechanics (long-term focus)

## Purpose

This repository contains experiments, simulations, and small projects built while studying engineering, mathematics, and system modeling.

The goal is to develop strong foundations in:

- mathematical modeling
- system simulation
- control theory
- engineering software development

## Structure

- `python-basics` → scientific Python and numerical computing
- `numerical-methods` → numerical algorithms and simulations
- `control-systems` → system modeling and control fundamentals
- `robotics` → robotics concepts and experiments
- `simulations` → physical and dynamic system simulations
- `notes` → technical notes and study summaries

## Approach

Study → Implement → Document → Improve.

All work is experimental and focused on learning.
